# Overview

I chose this project because of my recent discovery of my passion for app development. And during my research, I found out that flutter is one of the best platforms for developing mobile apps and so I dived into my first app, A dental Application. My goal is to become adept with the flutter platform and dart language. As well as becoming proficient in other platforms like React Native and Kotlin.

This is a Dental Mobile Application purposely designed for a dental clinic but in future, will make it accessible to other dental facilities. A user must sign in to access key features of the app. This is the current phase of the project. Without an account, a user only has access to the Medical AI chatbot for quick enquiries. The is also a location service features that rpovides direction using google maps right from the welcome screen, no need to sign up. Key features after creating an account include, video consultations, ability to book an appointment, check symptoms, track treatments, access dental videos. All frmo the comfort of your home.

The app is purposely designed to reduce the stress of having to travel long distance to a facility just to book an appointment for another day, consult with a dentist or check symptoms. It also has educational videos to prepare patients before taking a decision like RCT or Implants.
